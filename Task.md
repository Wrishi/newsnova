# Python Programming Test

## Your Task: A News Search Engine
Your task is to write a simple Flask-based web application, that allows to search in news articles. You can use any 3rd API to retrieve news content and donâ€™t have to implement your own indexing or database system. The frontend should contain a search bar which allows to enter any string, and the result after submitting the query should be a list of titles and URLs of the top matching news articles from (at least) the last month. Before executing the search, the user should be able to choose between German and English sources and the selection should be respected by the result list.
The overall project should contain a simple README and a requirements file.

## Hints
* If you use a secret key to access a third party API, don't submit your secret key, but add an explanation how to get a new one.

## Bonus points for: 
* Nice frontend with custom logo
* display thumbnail images with each result
